# Population average coefficients of inbreeding and relationship (fast_a_coefficients)
#   f_avg [fnz_avg] = average [nonzero] coefficient of inbreeding
#   f_n [fnz_n] = number of diagonal elements (animals) [>1] in the relationship matrix
#   f_sum [fnz_sum] = sum of [nonzero] coefficients of inbreeding
#   r_avg [rnz_avg] = average [nonzero] coefficient of relationship
#   r_n [rnz_n] = number of [non-zero] elements in the upper off-diagonal of A
#   r_sum [rnz_sum] = sum of [non-zero] elements in the upper off-diagonal of A
